                    <ul>
                        <li>Worked full-time as an intern and gained vast generative AI experience as the lead developer for the first-ever applications of generative AI for student learning and affairs at CMU.</li>
                        <li>As part of Dietrich's AI Pilot program, I worked in a small team of four people, including the Associate Dean of IT Operations. I developed and designed prototype chatbot scripts using Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG). Laid much of the initial groundwork for an initiative that ultimately saved several hours for the professor and TAs of the partnered course by having students' exit tickets submitted and summarized through a generative AI chatbot.</li>
                        <li>Proposed and demonstrated how students could chat with their syllabi and readings using RAG and generative AI powered by Langchain and GPT-4. As a result, I became the go-to expert in this emerging field and was sought out numerous times for advice and insight.</li>
                        <li>Initially consulted full-time as an intern to propose integrating the first working Generative AI-powered solution at CMU for a compact team of eight within Dietrich College. I proposed switching to Microsoft’s Azure with generative AI capabilities for the department’s ticketing and internal operations, which aligned with the vision of the Associate Dean of IT Operations.</li>
